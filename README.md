# Tinder-Swiper
Almost 80% of guys on Tinder reach a point where they blindy swipe until they run out of swipes. If you've reached that point or are too busy to swipe then this automated swiper is for you. Depending on your machine, you can set up an automated task that can run this script twice a day and send an initial message to matches so that you dont have to step in until you know your time wont be wasted.


If theres demand I will work on modifying the swiping process to accomodate for preferences.
